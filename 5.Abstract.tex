\chapter*{ABSTRACT}
Addressing the evolving landscape of education, this initiative responds to the critical need for innovative, data-driven methodologies to assess and improve students' academic performance. Utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning, the model aims to redefine conventional evaluation methods by emphasizing real-time analysis of live classroom interactions. Core objectives include establishing a dynamic feedback mechanism, leveraging NLP algorithms to assess communication skills, engagement, and content comprehension. The model incorporates sentiment analysis to discern emotional nuances during interactions and correlates these sentiments with academic performance. Deep learning models recognize individual learning paths, providing adaptive recommendations based on students' strengths and weaknesses. Additionally, the model quantifies and integrates participation metrics into overall academic evaluations, acknowledging the significance of collaborative engagement. This innovative approach is driven by the necessity to furnish educators with timely insights, fostering personalized learning experiences, and contributing to the broader discourse on data-driven, interactive, and adaptive learning methodologies. The potential impact lies in transforming educational practices, ushering in a more responsive and engaging paradigm for student evaluation in the contemporary educational landscape.
